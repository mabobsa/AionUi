# MindNProgress Runner sidecar

The personal AionUi fork can run a MindNProgress sub-machine Runner as a desktop sidecar. The sidecar starts and stops with AionUi, so users do not need a separate terminal command or login daemon.

## Requirements

- A packaged AionUi desktop build that includes the Runner sidecar
- An existing AionCore installation supported by that AionUi build; no separate AionCore rebuild is required
- Network access from the sub-machine to the main MindNProgress public URL
- A sub-machine registered by the same MindNProgress editor account that will use it

## Connect a sub-machine

1. Start AionUi on the intended sub-machine.
2. On that same machine, open the main MindNProgress URL in a browser and sign in.
3. Open **Distributed Work settings**, register the sub-machine, and select **Connect AionUi**.
4. Allow macOS or Windows to open the `aionui://` link.
5. In AionUi, verify the MindNProgress server and machine ID, then approve the connection.
6. Check the result under **Settings → Integrations → MindNProgress Runner**.
7. Return to MindNProgress, enable distributed work, select the default execution machine if needed, save, and run the connection probe.

To restore the Runner automatically after a reboot, enable **Settings → System → Start on boot**. AionUi starts after OS login and restores the configured Runner after its local AionCore is ready.

## Lifecycle and security

- Pairing links contain a target machine ID and a 10-minute, single-use code, never the durable Runner token.
- AionUi asks the user to confirm the server and machine ID. Redirected exchanges and mismatched responses are rejected.
- Credentials are encrypted with Electron `safeStorage`. Pairing is unavailable when the operating-system credential store is not secure.
- The token is not placed in renderer state, application routes, logs, or process arguments.
- The sidecar independently allows only the AionCore API routes and methods required by MindNProgress.
- Unexpected non-authentication exits restart automatically. Authentication rejection remains visible as an error instead of causing a restart loop.
- During AionUi shutdown, the sidecar stops claiming work and gets a short window to finish reporting claimed results before AionCore stops.
- An unconfigured AionUi does not launch the Runner process. Browser-only WebUI sessions do not expose the Runner settings page.

**Disconnect** removes the credential from this AionUi and stops its sidecar. To invalidate the server-side Runner permission as well, use **Revoke server permission** in MindNProgress Distributed Work settings. Pairing again also rotates the server token.
